PREFACE.


The Records of Auburn have a close and important relation to those of
Worcester, Leicester, Sutton and Oxford, towns prominent in the
history of the early settlement of central Massachusetts. Especially
are these Records supplementary to the Town Records of Worcester,
which have been edited and printed in full by the Trustee of the
Systematic History Fund, and they may be considered in reality a
continuation of the work which was comprehended in a plan formed by
him for the practical development of the original historical material
of this section.

With the exception of brief sketches in narrative form, comprised
in certain general works, nothing in the shape of a town history
of Auburn has been printed. Its Records are in a fair state of
preservation, but accessible only to those who are on the ground.
This first publication presents the full personal record (which in
every case is the true foundation of local history) so far as it
can be gathered from the town books, and added to this are the
inscriptions from the two older burial grounds in the town, all in
systematized form for reference.

Speaking in a general way, all local records of the early period in
New England are incomplete and imperfect, the degree varying to some
extent in different places, but none have been found entirely free
from omissions, discrepancies and other errors. The Records of Auburn
afford about the average number of such instances. But this statement
should not carry the implication that the value and practical
usefulness of town and other records are seriously impaired by the
small percentage of inaccuracies common in all human works, and of
which a large proportion can be rectified by effort and patience. The
substantial ground-work of the original entries in the Auburn town
books is here supplied, and the addition of the burial ground
inscriptions will aid in completing the record of deaths.

In the work of collecting and copying this material I have had
the benefit of the services of Mr. George Maynard as a competent
assistant. To Mr. Charles E. Prouty, the Town Clerk of Auburn, and to
Mrs. Prouty, my acknowledgments are due for their courtesy, and for
free access to the Records at all times.

HISTORICAL NOTE.


The Town of Auburn was originally set off from Worcester, Sutton,
Leicester and Oxford, and was incorporated on the 10th of April,
1778, with the name of Ward, in honor of General Artemas Ward, of
Shrewsbury, a man of great prominence in this region, active as a
patriot during the difficulties that caused the separation from
the mother country, and receiving on the eve of hostilities the
appointment of First Major General in the Revolutionary Army. He
was at a later period Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas,
and afterwards served in Congress. He died in 1800 at the age of
seventy-three.

A precinct was organized at this place July 27th, 1773, called the
South Parish of Worcester, and three years later the church was
formed. In 1777 Rev. Isaac Bailey became the first pastor.

More or less opposition was manifested against the formation of the
new township in the several places from which its territory was taken,
and committees were chosen to contest the proposed action in the
General Court. It is probable that the intention to separate from
the older towns had been cherished for several years by those who,
though nominally apart in corporate interests, were in their isolated
situation united for common convenience and protection of material
rights. This purpose after it was divulged could not long be
resisted, but the event was postponed for several years by a quasi
acknowledgment of independence. Twice in 1776 and 1777, as the Town
Records of Worcester testify, were special war taxes abated to the
inhabitants of the South Parish, perhaps with the hope of holding them
to their allegiance; but in the fall of the last named year the matter
was brought directly to a settlement, as appears by the following
extract from the Worcester Records:

    "The Town of Worcester Having been served with a Coppy of the
    Petition of William Phips & Charles Richardson praying 'the
    present members of the Precinct lately Erected out of Worcester,
    Leicester, Oxford & Sutton may be incorporated into a Town,
    according to a plan Exhibited with said petition &c. and the
    Hon{ble} General assemblys Resolve thereon, of the 24{th} day of
    Oct{r}. last, Requireing the said Towns to shew Cause, if any
    they have, on the third Wednesday of the next Session of the S{d}
    Court why the prayer of S{d} petition should not be granted.'

    The Town of Worcester, in answer to S{d} Petition and Order of
    Court, beg leave to say, that they have not been served with a
    plan of said town exhibited with said Petition to the Court, and
    therefore are not in a Capacity to offer reasons against, or to
    comply with it untill they know how far it Extends. But if the
    said plan Does not include any of those persons nor their Estates
    which belong to the Town of Worcester, and which were Excepted
    from being set off to said precinct when it was first Erected, We
    have no objections to their being made a Distinct Town. But if
    said plann includes those persons and their Estates who were first
    Exempted from belonging to said precinct, and are still unwilling
    to be set off to said Town, We beg leave to say we think it would
    be inconsistent to include a Number of persons & their Estates
    into the said New Town and still continue them to belong to the
    Town of Worcester, and to include them in the plann aforesaid &
    set them off against their Consent & the Consent of this Town, is
    departing from the principles upon which the said precinct was
    at first Erected, and will subject the said persons to an
    inconvenience that they had a right to Expect an Exemption from by
    the act of the General assembly & as the said persons who were
    first Exempted from belonging to S{d} Precinct and who are still
    unwilling to be set off to S{d} new Town and their Estates all
    lay upon the side of S{d} new Town next to Worcester, this Town
    are humbly of opinion that a line may be run between the Town of
    Worcester & the Sd new Town Leaving the S{d} persons & their
    Estates to the Town of Worcester without any Inconveniency to
    Either of the said Towns, which if complied with the Town of
    Worcester are Content.

On the 2d of February, 1778, in Worcester Town Meeting, it was voted
to choose two persons to meet the Committee of the General Court, to
view the proposed new township, and to fix the lines and boundaries;
and on the 23d of the same month, it was voted to remonstrate against
the proceedings of said Committee, and the lines established between
the towns, with what effect it does not appear.

                     *      *      *      *      *

On the 10th of the following April the Precinct was incorporated as a
Town and named Ward.

February 17th, 1837, the name of the Town was changed to Auburn. This
was influenced largely, it is said, by the confusion in writing the
names Ward and Ware by those not familiar with the two places.

The Order establishing the South Precinct or Parish of Worcester
comprises the names of those who were the first residents of the new
town, and the founders of the prominent families, the names of whose
immediate progeny and later descendants appear in the Records embodied
in this volume:

    In Council, June 19, 1773, ordered that Gershom Rice, Israel
    Stevens, David Bancroft, Jonathan Stone, Daniel Boyden, Jacob
    Stevens, Thomas Drury, Thomas Drury, Jr., Henry Gale, Wm.

    live not further than one mile and a half from said place, who

    Precinct aforesaid--Ordered that the spot for erecting the
    meeting-house upon be at the following place (viz)., at an Oak

    two acres of Land which Thomas Drury conveyed to Jonathan Stone,
    Daniel Boyden and David Bancroft; the said two acres of land lieth
    on the gore of land which was annexed to the town of Worcester.
